# Nested Virtual Machine In Virtual Machine

In this Quick Example, I show you how you can quickly create a Nested Virtual Machine on another Virtual Machine using Vagrant and Virtual Box

To test the sample, clone the repository and launch : 
```
vagrant up

```

This will create the nesting V.M and the nested V.M (thanks to vagrant shell provision)
